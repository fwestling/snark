INSTALLATION NOTES

1. Download and install JAI rpm package, as described here:
   http://www.jai.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/Camera_Solutions_Manuals/LinuxSDK_getting_started_guide.pdf
   
2. Don't worry about the environment variables; they are taken care of in snark.

   Known issues with JAI RPM (all patched in snark):
   
   - Some library paths are incorrect; snark cmake patches it by creating symlinks
   
   - If compiled with optimization (e.g. g++ -O2), genicam event handler times out
     on receiving frames. There possibly is a bug in genicam code, e.g missing
     volatile keyword. snark cmake fixes it by disabling optimization specifically
     for jai-cat

   - If not run as root, jai-cat sometimes gives the following error message:

   """
   Warning - Acquisition Thread is not allowed real-time priority! [1]
   Thread will be started with normal priority. Packet- and frame loss might occur!
   """

     This message is output to *stdout* after the first frame of output

3. Enable building jai-cat in ccmake (set snark_build_sensors_jai to ON)

CHECKING THE CAMERA

1. If you connect the camera to a switch, make sure the switch can handle jumbo frames.
   Also set MTU size to jumbo size in your /etc/network/interfaces file.

2. If you connect the camera directly to the ethernet card on your machine, make sure
   your interface (/etc/network/interfaces) is configured correctly. I should look
   similar to the example below. Make sure MTU size is set to jumbo size.

        auto eth1
        iface eth1 inet static
        address 192.168.0.3
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        mtu 8228

3. Connect the camera to the switch or an ethernet port on your computer.

4. Turn on the camera; wait until the LED behind turns from orange to green (it takes
   around 30 seconds).

5. If you connect directly to your computer, e.g. over eth1, run:

        sudo ifdown eth1
        sudo ifup eth1
        ping 192.168.0.4 # if you know that camera ip address is 192.168.0.4

   List cameras:
    
        > jai-cat --list-cameras-human-readable
        jai-cat: found 1 device(s)
        TL=>GevTL , INT=>::MAC->90-B1-1C-5D-73-A2::eth1 , DEV=>::MAC->00-0C-DF-08-01-54::JAI Ltd., Japan::AD-130GE_#0
        
   Take a look at the camera output (a window with the image from the camera should
   pop up - if it does not, please talk to Vsevolod Vlaskine):
    
        > jai-cat --id JAI "timestamp;view;null"
        
   If your computer is slow, try:
   
        > jai-cat --id JAI "timestamp;view;null" --discard
